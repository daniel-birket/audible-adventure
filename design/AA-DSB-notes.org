* Recent

This section contains recent log entries.

- [2022-08-11 Thu] Reading

  - Read about some audio library, taking notes below
  - Wrote a message @ spamming several GitHub users with similar interests
  - Question to LP for his thoughts on sound formats.

- [2022-08-10 Wed] Initial Commit

  - Read about current practice for python projects and created a
    bare-bones repository folder structure.
  - Found original FORTRAN source code from Will Crother and also Don
    Wood's version. Studied analysis by Dennis Jerz.
  - Started to study translation to Literate Programming style by Don Wood.

** Analysis of the Original FORTRAN ADVENT

This section lists references on the original FORTRAN versions of
ADVENT (ADV) and includes some notes on data structures as I read.

*** ADVENT Data

Scenes are either a place and/or a condition (you drowned)

- For each scene:
  - Long Scene Description
  - Short Scene Description
  - List Keywords (and its synonyms) to change to another scene
  - Most movements are object references, not compass points
- Words
  - Words have synonym-words and a key-word
  - Movement Words and synonyms
  - Object Words and synonyms
  - Action Words and synonyms
    - Default response
  - Message Words
    - Associated message(s)
- Objects and Treasures
  - Name
- Map Movement
  - Motion Word
  - Destination
  - Condition
    - Probability
    - Must have Object in Hand
    - Object must be Present
    - Object must have given property

** Lucia

I found a 'lucia' folder among my downloaded repositories dated
2022-03-11. Although I don't remember it, I have apparently run into
the idea of an audio game engine before, probably while looking for
stuff of interest to Lawrence.

- [[https://github.com/luciasoftware/lucia]['lucia' repository]]

I have little memory of this and probably never took the time to
build the docs. At a glance, I have the impression that this is a
library upon which to build an audio-centric game. The example 'games'
are very short, one literally a 'Hello World' demo that appear to be
focused on exercising elements of the library, probably audio.

The development and master branches were abandoned two years ago.
It appears that they got about as far toward a useful product as I
realistically expect to get with the audible-adventure exercise.

See https://amerikranian.github.io/Python-guide/game_frameworks.html

** BGT

This appears to be a defunct audio-game script language and engine.

"BGT is a new revolutionary toolkit which allows you to produce your
own audio games from the ground up, without having any prior knowledge
of computer programming at all."

"The development of bgt stopped working: since along time ago, the
development of bgt which is blastbay game toolkit stopped
working. however, the bgt is not been deleted, you can still code with
the latest features in version 1.3. but now python will be a good and
best programming language for games development, but still, good to
keep it up for a while, bgt!"

"If you are learning bgt and python together, then I recommend you not
to learn bgt, since you're already learning python, a good nor best
programming language."

** PySDL2

A pure python ctypes wrapper for Simple DirectMedia Layer. These 'mixer' calls are under
the PyGame calls for 'mixer'. See https://pysdl2.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/tutorial/pygamers.html
