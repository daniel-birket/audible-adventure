* Game Data

This section outlines the data that defines the game.

** Keyword Dictionary

The keyword dictionary lists the synonyms of the keywords actually
used by the game logic.  It is defined as a dictionary indexed
by keyword, each with a list of synonyms.

To speed lookup later, it will be cross-referenced into a synonym
dictionary, with each entry indexed by synonym and referencing the
equivalent keyword (or 'None' if the word is already a keyword).
