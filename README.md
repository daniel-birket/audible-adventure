An accessible Adventure-like game and engine with a hybrid text and
audio user interface.

## Hello and Welcome!

Welcome to Audible-Adventure, a collaborative project to create an
accessible Adventure-like game engine and script with an audible
experience.

I'm sorry that you've come too early to play the game, but you're not
too early to help create it. Our team already includes:

- An expert in accessible technology for the blind.
- A player of the original FORTRAN ADVENT game in the 80's
- A student of Python and programming.
- A veteran software engineer.
- A composer of original music.
- A web site accessibility auditor.
- A FORTRAN programmer, just in case!
- A digital musician.
- A professional technical writer.
- An audio engineer.

We will need:

- a game designer.
- a web site designer.
- a script writer.
- voice actors
- foley artists
- who knows, we've only just begun!
